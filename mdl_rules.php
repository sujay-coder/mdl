            <h2>Beginners</h2>
            <h3>BAG GLOVES</h3>
            <p>To start off right, you need to have quality equipment that will provide adequate protection and give you some room to advance. Your gloves should be well-formed and fully padded. They should provide the kind of punching surface that, even if you don’t wrap your hands perfectly or hit your target accurately, they are forgiving and will keep you from getting injured.</p>
            <h3>SPARRING GLOVES</h3>
            <p>Although, in the beginning, your sparring may be light and infrequent, it's still necessary to have the right gloves to hit and get hit with. It's best to begin with softer, heavily-padded gloves that will allow you to get accustomed to getting hit and will provide the best learning experience possible for both you and your sparring partner.</p>
            <h3>HANDWRAPS</h3>
            <p>Your handwraps should be long enough to give you full coverage and protect properly, but not so long that it impedes your ability to make a fist or add unnecessary weight. The right wrap will form and contour perfectly to the shape of your hand.</p>
            <h3>HEADGEAR</h3>
            <p>The headgear you start with should be form-fitting and not bulky. It should have ample coverage for your cheeks, nose, mouth and chin. You may take more punches starting out than you would like, so err on the side of having a headgear with more cushion and comfort.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="rules_con">
            <h2>Intermediaries</h2>
            <h3>BAG GLOVES</h3>
            <p>As you get more advanced, hitting harder and landing with more frequency, the amount of padding and protection your gloves provide becomes more important. You will also become more discerning about the quality of gloves you use, how they fit and the level of performance. Ideally your bag gloves will have a more dense foam than your sparring gloves might have, for instance, so that they will stand up to the pounding you'll be giving a heavy bag. A more solid foam will hold up longer and provide the amount of protection you need when striking harder surfaces.</p>
            <h3>SPARRING GLOVES</h3>
            <p>Moving up in skill level, punching power, speed and accuracy, you'll need sparring gloves that compliment your progress. Adequate padding, a perfectly, pre-curved design, along with a higher level of wrist support will allow you to punch with confidence at this next phase of your career. The padding should be soft, but not spongy and should curve to the shape of your hand, especially as you break them in over time.</p>
            <h3>HANDWRAPS</h3>
            <p>Your handwraps should be long enough to give you full coverage and protect properly, but not so long that it impedes your ability to make a fist or add unnecessary weight. The right wrap will form and contour perfectly to the shape of your hand.</p>
            <h3>HEADGEAR</h3>
            <p>How you wrap your hands and the quality of materials you wrap them with becomes more critical as you become a better boxer. Some elasticity creates some “give” as you wrap your hands, but also creates a more stable, contoured fit that you can feel on impact. Wrapping your hands properly is an important part of your progress, because boxers plagued by hand injuries are constantly working at a disadvantage.</p>

            <h2>Advance</h2>
            <h3>BAG GLOVES</h3>
            <p>When you're the top of your game, your head and your hands become precious tools of the trade and can only be trusted to the best. Your gloves are the last place to cut corners and you'll want the best fit, feel and performance every round you spend in the gym. High quality construction and blending of materials that hold up to round after round of heavy work are necessary. The right gloves should allow you to make a complete fist, provide full wrist support, knuckle protection and encourage you to connect with precision and accuracy.</p>
            <h3>SPARRING GLOVES</h3>
            <p>Sparring becomes a more common part of your training routine the higher up you get in the sport, so the gloves you wear become more important. They need to have ample padding and a perfect anatomically-correct shape. The right sparring glove should be form-fitting and compact like a pro fight glove, but with more padding. It should be similar to what you’ll be actually fighting in so that you can get accustomed to the feel.</p>
            <h3>HANDWRAPS</h3>
            <p>Once you’ve hit the elite level of the sport, competing with the very best in the game, protecting the 29 small bones in your hands becomes an art. A longer, elastic style wrap will give you the most protection. It will provide some “give” when making a full fist, but will also provide the exact amount of support you need to keep every bone in place to land the perfect punch.</p>
            <h3>HEADGEAR</h3>
            <p>Avoiding taking unnecessary punishment is crucial when you're fighting at the highest levels of the amateur ranks or in the pros. At this point, your future and your profession may depend on having headgear that protects every contact point, from your cheeks and chin, to your forehead, nose and eyes. Your training headgear can help prevent injury and damage that might otherwise slow your career down or stop it completely.</p>
